# payroll_3c

Custom Payroll module scaffold for Odoo 17 (VN-ready).

- Depends: `base`, `hr`
- App icon and application flag are set so it appears in Apps.

What’s included now
- Security groups for roles (Employee, Officer, Manager, Approver)
- Access rights for core models
- Sequences for payslip and batch
- Core models: category, rule, structure, payslip(+line), batch, vn params

Developers: read `DEV_GUIDE.txt` to continue implementation without reading code.
